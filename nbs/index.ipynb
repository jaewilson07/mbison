    "- `client.DomoAuth` encapsulates authentication.  Can init with username/password or access_token\n",
    "- For consistency, use `client.domo_api_request` to handle API requests in route functions.  `domo_api_requests` and `route functions` should always return an instance of `client.ResponseGetData` class.  For streaming responses, use `client.domo_api_stream_request` to automagically download API responses in route functions.\n",
    "- `Route Functions` should always throw an error if not `ResponseGetData.is_success`\n",
    "\n",
    "Features or classes are implemented as separate notebooks and then exported into their own module folder (see `default_exp` line in each .ipynb file)\n",
    "- each feature should be implemented as series of route functions ('GET', 'PUT', 'POST' requests), then a `@dataclass` class may be used to represent the feature with methods that wrap and provide logic around route functions.\n",
    "    - ex. an UPSERT method might wrap logic to test if the entity already exists (in which case call the PUT route) or create the entity if it doesn't already exist ('POST')\n",
    "- `@classmethods` return an instance of the class\n",
    "    - ex. each class should have a `get_by_id` method which returns an instance of the entity (typically the result of the search datacenter API)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations, take a set of features and create a use case or project\n",
    "    - ex.back up code engine and custom app (features) into appdb collections (feature)"
